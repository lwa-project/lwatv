These images show a simulation of the sky above the first LWA station. They update every 10 minutes and show where the beamformed observations are pointing.  Each beam is represented by two circles, one for each of the frequencies being observed, and up to four beams can be used simultaneously.  The text to the upper right of the shows which LWA projects are using which beams.

We've labeled the brightest objects in the sky: 
Cas A -- a supernova remnant 
Vir A -- a supergiant elliptical galaxy also known as M87 
Tau A -- the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant 
Cyg A -- a bright radio galaxy in the constellation of Cygnus
Jupiter -- Jupiter, which only can be seen when it is bursting 
Sun -- the Sun, which can become so bright that it wipes out everything else in the image! 
Dotted line -- the plane of our galaxy 
Sgr A -- the center of our galaxy
Her A -- another bright radio galaxy in the constellation of Hercules
For A -- another bright radio galaxy in the constellation of Fornax
